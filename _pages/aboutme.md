Welcome to my virtual habitat. Consider it both an addendum to my curriculum vitae as well as a stage for sharing my thoughts on (non-) engineering matters. Please do get in touch and let us chat and discuss. I do love the dialogue. 

I am a curious engineering professional and have been active in the built environment with a focus on infrastructure. Think transit, think rail, think tunnels. 

My personal trajectory describes a path starting from relatively mono-disciplinary roles towards more generalist jack-of-all-trades kind of roles. I like to think about integrating technology in some larger context, keeping the overall purpose and (full) picture in mind.

Some topics I feel strongly about or sympathetic towards are the energy transition, the repair movement and (sustainable) manufacturing.

Activities ’on the side’: I take a profound interest in learning languages . I try to visit the Goethe’s Institute monthly book gathering to discuss German literature. As a relic from the past as a hobby (web) programmer I still like to write the occasional line of code, maintaining the photography website of my father.
