In my professional history I have worked on the following projects.

- The Wunderline is the envisioned railway connection between Groningen and Bremen. In essence it consists of several measures along the existing route such as increased block density, soil enhancement and speed improvements. Implementation is phased with 2025 and 2030 as key milestones. 

- The NorthSouth metro line is one of my bigger projects up to date and has prompted my interest for metro and rail related transit projects in urban areas. I have had the opportunity to test the lion's share of the station and tunnel bound installations.

Privately I have embarked on some projects as well.

- Building a photography website (for my father). This is a legacy activity from my high school days when I was a hobby coder. [www.kbfoto.nl](http://www.kbfoto.nl).
