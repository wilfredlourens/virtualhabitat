Growing up in the very same city in the nineties and the first decade of this century, the project was latently present, e.g. through snippets of news mentioning the usual setbacks, controversies and budget overruns. Interestingly enough, I found myself actually working on the project in the final two years up until its completion. Nowadays, upon the occasional metro ride I undertake, I cannot help reminiscing about the modest contribution I was allowed to make to this engineering feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will explain what my contribution looked like and how I feel about this experience looking back. I will gently dabble in the technical aspects, while also sharing my take on how things were organized. Please note that this is a personal story and one should not take it for gospel, as my personal perspective only accounts for a tiny part of the project, both in time and scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an impression, I usually walked around like this.&lt;/p&gt;
