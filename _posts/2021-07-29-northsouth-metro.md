The construction of the North/South metro line is perhaps the most iconic project on which the city of Amsterdam ever embarked. Growing up in the very same city in the nineties and the first decade of this century, the project was latently present, e.g. through snippets of news mentioning the usual setbacks, controversies and budget overruns. Interestingly enough, I found myself actually working on the project in the final two years up until its completion. Nowadays, upon the occasional metro ride I undertake, I cannot help reminiscing about the modest contribution I was allowed to make to this engineering feat.

In this article, I will explain what my contribution looked like and how I feel about this experience looking back. I will gently dabble in the technical aspects, while also sharing my take on how things were organized. Please note that this is a personal story and one should not take it for gospel, as my personal perspective only accounts for a tiny part of the project, both in time and scope.

To give you an impression, I usually walked around like this.

What kind of image pops up when you think of a metro station in particular? Perhaps you imagine the platform, with people casting glances at the screen displaying the remaining minutes until the next arriving train. You might think of the passengers rushing up and down the escalators and stair cases, entering and exiting through beeping ticket gates. You might even think of the occasional announcements of arriving and departing trains or (possibly) disturbances and emergencies.

Regardless of the particular image of a metro station that you just conjured up, it most likely was not a bland cavern. It probably contained things we call installations, things that contribute to a safe and comfortable experience of a traveller. Think of the escalator that gets a passenger to the platform, the lights that illuminate your surroundings
